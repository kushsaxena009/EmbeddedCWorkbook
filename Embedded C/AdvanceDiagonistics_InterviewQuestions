Question 1
Write a simple algorithm to shuffle all the integer numbers, with the following property:
Any 3 consecutive numbers in the final shuffle should NOT be monotonically ordered, as in this example:

0,1,2,4,3 would NOT be a valid sequence as 0,1 and 2 are monotonically increasing.
4,3,2,0,1 would not be a valid sequence as 4,3 and 2 are monotonically decreasing.
1,0,3,2,4 would be a valid sequence

Function prototype should be: int shuffle(int N), being N the maximum number of integers

Question 2

Write a simple C/C++ program generates a list of (up to 2000) random numbers.
After generating the random numbers, please sort them (ascending) and display them on the screen.

Question 3

Having the algorithm described in the file hash_algo.c
Let's assume you have an executable that runs this algorithm.
Each time you execute it, you have to insert the value for the seed parameter and read out the result from hashAlgo.
The executable also stores a secret key, which is used each time, together with your seed to create a result.
How would you proceed in order to be able to find out the secret key stored in?
What different seed values would you choose and why?

Question 4

Consider the following list of numbers 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4....,p,p,p,...., 1000,1000.
As you can see all the numbers from 1 to 1000, appear in the list twice, except one number p which appears three times.
The initial list is randomly shuffled and saved into a file. 
Write a program that reads out the shuffled list and detects (in a reasonable amount of time)   
the number p that appears three times.

Question 5

Determine what possible problems you can identify with the program from file_decode.c
